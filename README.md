AI Connector:
This app was created as a proof of concept to link a desktop app to ChatGPT.
ChatGPT was used to generate some of the code to do the connection.
It was extremely hard to resolve the issues such as connection max limits etc maybe because I have not purchased the subsription yet.
You will need your own key and insert it in the code to run this.
